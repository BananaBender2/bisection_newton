# bisection_newton
Find root for function with bisection method or newton raphsons method

# how does it work
First you need to download the extern libaries imported (sympy, termcolor)
using: pip install (libary_name)

After this the program needs a given value between 1 and 2 to choose between
the 2 methods

IF you choose bisection, you need to give an interval in which there is a root for a function, which you will give afterwards, the algorithm will afterwards output the x-axis' root (estimated)

IF you choose newton raphsons method, you'll give a function and a starting point for x, the algorithm will output the x-axis' root (estimated)
